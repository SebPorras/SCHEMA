SCHEMA-RICE
============

This is a software package for protein engineers. It uses protein structure and sequence information to aid researchers in designing protein recombination libraries.

SCHEMA was developed originally developed in the laboratory of Frances H. Arnold at the California Institute of Technology. 

These tools can calculate SCHEMA energies of chimeric proteins and run the RASPP algorithm to find optimal library designs. The package includes documentation and examples. 

SCHEMA-RICE modifies the original SCHEMA algorithm and takes into account the nature of the interaction, not just the proximity of the groups. 
This work was performed by Weiliang Huang in the labratory of Elizabeth Gillam at The University of Queensland.
