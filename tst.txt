usage: rice.py [-h] -pdb PDB -msa MSA -xo XO [-pdbal PDBAL] [-chains CHAINS]
               [-min MIN] [-bin BIN] [-o output.txt] [-con contacts.txt]

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -pdb PDB           A PDB file from the Protein Data Bank
  -msa MSA           A multiple sequence alignment in ALN format (e.g.
                     ClustalW)
  -xo XO             The number of crossovers
  -pdbal PDBAL       (Optional) In ALN format. If this argument is not
                     provided, then the PDB file's ID (e.g., 1G68) will be
                     extracted, and the sequence having that ID in the
                     multiple sequence alignment file will be used
  -chains CHAINS     (Optional) The PDB chain identifers (e.g. -chain A B)
                     Chains 'A' and ' ' are included by default.
  -min MIN           The minimum fragment length (minus invariant positions),
                     in residues. Default min is 4
  -bin BIN           (Optional) The width of each average mutation bin.
                     Default bin is 1.
  -o output.txt      (Optional) Specify where you want your RASPP curve to be
                     saved. If this option is not used, output will be printed
                     to stdout.
  -con contacts.txt  (Optional) You can provide an existing contact file you
                     have previously created. If not specified, rice.py will
                     generate a new file called contacts.txt.
