options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -pdb PDB        A PDB file from the Protein Data Bank
  -msa MSA        A multiple sequence alignment in ALN format (e.g. ClustalW)
  -xo XO          The number of crossovers
  -pdbal PDBAL    (Optional) In ALN format. If this argument is not provided,
                  then the PDB file's ID (e.g., 1G68) will be extracted, and
                  the sequence having that ID in the multiple sequence
                  alignment file will be used
  -chains CHAINS  The PDB chain identifers (e.g. -chain A B) Chains 'A' and '
                  ' are included by default.
  -cout COUT      (Optional) Will create or overwrite a contact file (eg
                  contacts.txt)
  -min MIN        The minimum fragment length (minus invariant positions), in
                  residues. Default min is 4
  -bin BIN        The width of each average mutation bin
  -o O            Will create or overwrite a file called averages.txt
  -con CON        -con contacts.txt In the format output by schemacontacts.py.
